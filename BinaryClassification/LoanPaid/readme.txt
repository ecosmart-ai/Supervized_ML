use lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. 
source data :https://www.lendingclub.com/auth/login?login_url=%2Fstatistics%2Fadditional-statistics%3F

Here are what the columns represent:

credit.policy: 1 if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, and 0 otherwise.
purpose: The purpose of the loan (takes values "credit_card", "debt_consolidation", "educational", "major_purchase", "small_business", and "all_other").
int.rate: The interest rate of the loan, as a proportion (a rate of 11% would be stored as 0.11). Borrowers judged by LendingClub.com to be more risky are assigned higher interest rates.
installment: The monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded.
log.annual.inc: The natural log of the self-reported annual income of the borrower.
dti: The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower (amount of debt divided by annual income).
fico: The FICO credit score of the borrower.
days.with.cr.line: The number of days the borrower has had a credit line.
revol.bal: The borrower's revolving balance (amount unpaid at the end of the credit card billing cycle).
revol.util: The borrower's revolving line utilization rate (the amount of the credit line used relative to total credit available).
inq.last.6mths: The borrower's number of inquiries by creditors in the last 6 months.
delinq.2yrs: The number of times the borrower had been 30+ days past due on a payment in the past 2 years.
pub.rec: The borrower's number of derogatory public records (bankruptcy filings, tax liens, or judgments).

# LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.[3] It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

# ### Our Goal
# 
# Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), can we build a model thatcan predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan. Keep in mind classification metrics when evaluating the performance of your model!
